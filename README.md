# CRUD Application

it was two years since I used Laravel for my backend projects.
I found next js and server components more convenient for backend development since it's easier to maintain the whole structure although it's slower because of the heavy dependency tree etc...
but after a quick review, I eventually started the project.

now about DDD and BDD concepts:
- I found the DDD approach very time-consuming for such a small project (only 4 controllers) to be domain-driven so I skipped it.
- Implimentation for Behaviour-Driven-Development is not straight forward as well and the only package I could find for BDD was the Bahat Package which was confusing to use at least at first.

overall this project has lots of downsides which could be fixed if I had more time or if I was able to use my preferred tools.
